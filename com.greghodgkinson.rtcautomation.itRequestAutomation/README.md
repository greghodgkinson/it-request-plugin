# IT Request Automation Plugin

Plugin for a Rational Team Concert that provides automated behaviour for workflow of IT Request work items.

Implementation of the ideas written about in this blog posting: http://continualoop.blogspot.com/2017/11/a-solution-for-tracking-and-monitoring.html

This plugin is meant to be used as a reference to see how to extend Rational Team Concert, rather than a plugin for you to use directly.

## Getting Started

1. Import the code into your Eclipse workspace
2. Setup your Eclipse workspace for plugin development following the steps for lab 1 in the Extensions Workshop documented here: https://jazz.net/library/article/1000
3. Suggest working through a few of the labs in the Extensions Workshop (preferably all the labs) to make sure you are comfortable with the RTC SDK and how to write extensions
4. Review the blog posting about the concepts this plugin is based on: http://continualoop.blogspot.com/2017/11/a-solution-for-tracking-and-monitoring.html
4. Review the code in this plugin to see how these concepts were implemented
